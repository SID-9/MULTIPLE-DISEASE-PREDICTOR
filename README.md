## Motivation

Early detection of heart and liver diseases can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely intervention. This project leverages machine learning to create predictive models that can assist healthcare providers and individuals in identifying potential risks based on medical data. The Streamlit deployment allows for easy and interactive use of the models.

## Datasets

The datasets used for this project contain medical records and diagnostic information related to heart and liver diseases. The features include various medical parameters such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, liver enzyme levels, and other relevant biomarkers.

## Preprocessing Techniques

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
3. **Scaling**: Normalizing the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.

## Model Implementation

The machine learning models are developed using the following steps:

1. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
3. **Model Training**: Training the models on the training data.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Streamlit Deployment

The models are deployed using Streamlit, creating an interactive web application with the following features:

1. **User Input**: A form for users to input their medical data.
2. **Prediction**: Displaying the prediction results based on the input data.
3. **Explanation**: Providing insights into the models' decision-making process.

## Results

The models provide accurate predictions for heart and liver diseases based on the input medical data. The Streamlit app enhances user experience by offering an easy-to-use interface and clear visualization of the results.

## Future Work

- **Model Enhancement**: Experiment with additional algorithms and hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporate more features to capture a broader range of medical conditions.
- **Mobile Deployment**: Develop a mobile-friendly version of the Streamlit app for wider accessibility.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning in healthcare, providing tools for early prediction of heart and liver diseases. By deploying the models using Streamlit, it offers an accessible and interactive platform for users to benefit from predictive analytics in medical diagnostics.
